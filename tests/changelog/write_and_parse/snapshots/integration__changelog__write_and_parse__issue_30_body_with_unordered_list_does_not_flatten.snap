## v1.0.0 (1970-01-01)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-0000000000000000000000000000000000000001/> Remove hidden bogosort functionality
   If users turn out to be depending on bogosort, we may:
   
   - Add instructions for using an earlier version.
   - Add back bogosort and document it properly.
   
   We defaulted to bogosort on Tuesdays based on these mistaken beliefs:
   
   - Bogosort runs in O(n log n log log n log log log n) if you have an odd number of RAM sticks.
   - The software can never be run on Tuesday.
 - <csr-id-0000000000000000000000000000000000000002/> Time zones are remembered across sessions
